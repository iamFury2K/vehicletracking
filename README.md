# Traffic Monitoring System

## Project Overview
This project utilizes computer vision techniques to monitor traffic through a video feed, specifically tracking vehicle movements across predefined lines (red and blue) to determine their direction. The system identifies and counts vehicles like cars, bicycles, motorcycles, and trucks as they cross these lines.

## Features
- **Real-Time Vehicle Detection and Tracking:** Leverages object detection and tracking to identify vehicles in motion and track their paths across the video frame.
- **Directional Counting:** Counts vehicles moving in specific directions using designated line crossings to monitor traffic flow patterns effectively.
- **Visual Feedback:** Provides real-time visual feedback by drawing bounding boxes around detected vehicles, lines that vehicles cross, and textual data indicating vehicle counts.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **OpenCV:** Used for all image processing tasks, including reading video frames, drawing on frames, and displaying the video.
- **Pandas:** Manipulates data and organizes the detected bounding box coordinates.
- **Your Custom Object Detection and Tracking Models:** Assumes the existence of `model.predict` for detection and `tracker.update` for tracking vehicles.

## Setup and Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system, then install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless pandas
```

## How to Use
1. **Prepare Your Video Source:** The video source should be connected or the video file path should be specified in the script.
2. **Run the Script:** Execute the script to start processing the video feed. The script outputs processed frames with visual annotations and directional counts.

## Code Explanation
- **Reading Video Frames:** Continuously reads frames from the video source until the video ends.
- **Frame Processing:** Each frame is resized and processed to detect and track vehicles.
- **Direction Detection:** Vehicles crossing the designated red and blue lines are counted based on their direction - moving up or down.
- **Visual Annotations:** Lines, vehicle paths, and counts are drawn onto the frame for real-time monitoring.
- **Output:** The processed video can be viewed live and is saved frame-by-frame.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve the accuracy and efficiency of the object detection and tracking models.
- Extend functionality to include different types of vehicles and traffic conditions.
- Develop a more robust system for handling different lighting and weather conditions.
